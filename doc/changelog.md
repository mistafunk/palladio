# Palladio ChangeLog

## v1.6.0-beta.1 (???, 2019)
* Added support for PRT 2

## v1.5.0-beta.2 (Mar 19, 2019)
* Fixed crash in pldAssign node if no RPK is set.

## v1.5.0-beta.1 (Mar 14, 2019)
* Added support for Rule Packages (RPK) embedded in Houdini Digital Assets (HDA)
* Added support for Houdini 17.5

## v1.4.1 (Mar 11, 2019)
* Always use UV set 0 as a fallback (mimics CityEngine behavior).
* Internal cleanup: Simplified UV coordinate transport between PRT and Palladio.

## v1.4.0 (Feb 27, 2019)
* Generated material primitive attributes now use the "generic names" instead of the "CGA names" (see PRT reference for file prtx/Material.h for details).
* Fixed wrong texture paths for assets that originated in another CityEngine project (e.g. ESRI.lib) at RPK creation time.

## v1.3.1 (Feb 20, 2019)
* Added a workaround to prevent a crash in PRT 1.9 when using an invalid CGB path in the assign node.

## v1.3.0 (Jan 20, 2019)
* Update build system to support both Houdini 16.5 and 17.0.
* For Houdini 17, use bundled boost libraries.

## v1.2.0 (Jan 17, 2019)
* Build System changes to improve continuous integration support (Jenkins).
* Updated required cmake version to 3.13 (preparation for Houdini 17 support).
* Added pipenv script for easier access to conan.
* Reduced Houdini package size.

## v1.2.0-rc.1 (Jun 11, 2018)
* Support for inter-shape occlusion queries (#33).

## v1.1.1 (Apr 16, 2018)
* Fixed asset loading issues in Windows build (#88).

## v1.1 (Apr 7, 2018)
* Added support for Windows (#85).
* Raised minimal Houdini version to 16.5.x (#85).
* Added support to reload RPKs (#58).

## v1.0 (Jan 26, 2018)
* Renamed project to "Palladio" (#68).
* Updated documentation (#38).
* Published demo scene (#74).

## v0.9 (Jan 18, 2018)
* Add support for writing out primitive attributes from rule/generic CGA attributes (#40).
* Removed random seed parameter UI, read it from incoming primitive attributes instead. Added centroid-based random seed as fallback.
* Correctly update assign node parameters from RPK (#62).
* Make primitive group creation optional and based on primitive classifier (#67).
* Add support for CityEngine network licensing (#41).
* Fixed crash when handling invalid RPK paths.
* Remove style prefix on primitive attribute names.

## v0.8 (Dec 19, 2017)
* Added support for multiple UV sets (#36).
* Added support for CGA reports (#39).
* Properly use Houdini input mesh connectivity (make CGA operation "isClosedSurface" work correctly) (#49).
* Refactored assign node to correctly use incoming geometry to evaluate default rule attribute values.

## v0.7.1 (Nov 27, 2017)
* Proper support for UVs and material attributes.
* Introduced Conan to handle 3rd party packages in the build system (Houdini, CityEngine).
* Updated to CityEngine SDK 2017.1 (CE SDK 1.9).

## v0.7 (Sep 19, 2017)
* Split plugin into two SOPs ("assign" and "generate") to support proper evaluation of rule attribute default values.
* Abandoned rule param UI, purely rely on Houdini attribute tools (e.g. "AttributeCreate") to create/modify rule attributes (= no need for complicated UI on assign node).
* Updated to Houdini 16 and CityEngine 2017.
* Dropped Windows/macOS support temporarily.

## v0.6 (Mar 15, 2016)
* Support for rule attribute UI via Houdini multi-parameter.
* Experimental support for Windows/macOS.
* Updated to Houdini 15 and CityEngine 2016.

## v0.4 (Oct 22, 2015)
* Working geometry generation from CityEngine rule packages
* Support to read rule attributes from primitive attributes
* Implemented rule execution as single surface operator (SOP).
* Updated to Houdini 13 and CityEngine 2015.

## v0.1 - v0.3 (Spring 2015)
* Early experiments with Houdini 12 and CityEngine 2014.
